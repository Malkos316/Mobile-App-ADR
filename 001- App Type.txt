001 - App Type

Context:
-Given a short list of requirement, we where asked to decide what type of application would best suit a food delivery application

Decision:
-My decision was that we would use a Hybrid App

Consequences:
-I did not choose a natve application because I believed that there would be a good market share of users that would prefer using application with a keyboard/mouse for ease of navigation when searching.
-I did not choose a web application because I believed that there would be users that would prefer to use this application on the go.
-There will be more device testing required because it is a hybrid app.
-there will be a larger time requirement because the app will need to be accesible by many devices with different operating systems.

Status: 
-Proposed
