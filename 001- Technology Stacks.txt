001 - Frameworks and Technology Stacks

Context:
- Determine the technology stacks required for the current application requirements

Decision:
	- UI - Java, React, Next.js
	- Services - Payment services, Security
	- Database - AWS
	- OS -Windows/macOS, Android/IOS

Consequences:
- Using frameworks I'm familiar with should reduce development time.
- Having a web based Database works for this application since it needs to be connected to the internet to function anyways.
- The app being able to run on both android and apple devices will make development more time consuming.
- Using a payment API will reduce development costs.
